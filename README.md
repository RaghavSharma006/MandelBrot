## About the Mandelbrot Set üåÄ

The [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) is one of the most famous **fractal structures** in mathematics, discovered by Beno√Æt Mandelbrot in 1980. It is often referred to as the "**God's set**" because of its infinite complexity and beauty, revealing intricate patterns at every scale.

Mathematically, a point \$c\$ in the complex plane belongs to the Mandelbrot set if the iterative sequence defined by \$z\_{n+1} = z\_n^2 + c\$ (starting with \$z\_0 = 0\$) **does not escape to infinity**.

## About the Julia Set üåÄ

The [Julia set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set) is another fascinating **fractal structure** closely related to the Mandelbrot set, named after French mathematician Gaston Julia. Each Julia set corresponds to a specific complex number \$c\$, and its shape can vary from connected and smooth to highly fragmented.

Mathematically, a point \$z\_0\$ in the complex plane belongs to the Julia set for a given \$c\$ if the iterative sequence defined by \$z\_{n+1} = z\_n^2 + c\$ **does not escape to infinity**, starting from that \$z\_0\$. Julia sets reveal an incredible diversity of patterns, making them both visually stunning and mathematically rich.

## Mandelbrot & Julia Set Connection üîó

The Mandelbrot set is more than just a stunning fractal ‚Äî it is the **superset of all Julia sets**. Every point in the Mandelbrot set corresponds to a unique Julia set.

* If the point lies **inside the Mandelbrot set** (typically black regions), the corresponding Julia set is **connected** ‚Äî a beautiful, unbroken fractal.
* If the point lies **outside the Mandelbrot set**, the Julia set becomes **disconnected** or "dusty" ‚Äî fragmented into tiny islands.

The deeper you explore the Mandelbrot set (zooming in), the more complex and varied the Julia sets become. This shows how every Julia set is a reflection of a specific point in the Mandelbrot set, making the Mandelbrot set a map of all possible Julia sets.
